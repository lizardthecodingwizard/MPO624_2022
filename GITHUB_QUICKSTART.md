# Create an account on Github, and `Clone` the class repository

----------
1. **Install** the desktop client (app) at https://desktop.github.com/. (This won't interfere with the ability to use command-line git.)

2. **Make an account** on github.com (the desktop client will prompt you on launch, or go directly in a browser).
   - Link your desktop client to your GitHub account by typing your username and password into it.

### Clone the course repo, to allow updates and collaboration

3. **Fork** the course repo with the button at upper right on its [page](https://github.com/MPO624/MPO624-2020).

4. **Clone your Fork** to your local machine.

   - In the GitHub desktop client's upper left corner, in the **Add** menu choose **Clone**.

   - You will have to select or create a folder for it on your own computer. The default is probably a smart way to organize your folders, study it (and I recommend to accept it). It will have some hidden files (under a folder called .git) that keep track of versions and branches, invisibly to you.
